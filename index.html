      	<p>Earlier this year, on July 16, the Biden-⁠Harris Administration officially launched the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Despite the national rollout of the lifeline, it is still up to the individual states to create legislation to fund and organize the operation of the resource. </p>

        <p>Fountain House, a mental health rehabilitation organization in New York City is dedicated to aiding the development of such legislation. Fountain House refers to its community as a clubhouse and it serves more than 2,000 members in New York.</p>

        <p>Through networking and teaching, the clubhouse has partnered with 200 other organizations located in over 40 states. Minhee Cho, the clubhouse’s director of media strategy said all of the partnered organizations have adopted Fountain House’s methods of rehabilitation which are centered around community and empowering people with mental illness to have agency over their own recovery.</p>

        <p>“Even if you combine all the 200 clubhouses, we're only all collectively serving about 60,000 people. So we're doing great work, but it's really a drop in the bucket. We're not going to be able to create the change that this community deserves until this model is really expanded and embraced more nationwide,” said Cho.</p>

        <p>Today, only 24 of the 50 states in the US have established legislation to sustain the 988 lifeline long-term. In pursuit of a nationwide change, Fountain House has become an advocate for policy changes that would help more states pass this legislation.</p>

        <p>Cho said, “At our clubhouse, we've taken part in advocating for what we call care response. We're advocating for mental health professionals, emergency medical technicians and peer specialists to be the ones answering these calls.”</p>

        <p>In 2016, a Fountain House member, Deborah Danner, was shot and killed by the NYPD while experiencing a mental health crisis and the effects of this event have been felt throughout the community. </p>

        <p>“Many of our folks are really intimidated and scared by law enforcement and it's something that we hope will change through these types of policy pushes,” said Cho.</p>

        <p>According to Cho, the clubhouse uses its national network of fellow clubhouse partners based in California, Michigan, Washington State, Florida, Ohio, and New York. The most recent bill the clubhouse helped support was AB 988 which established an emergency response system in California and was passed in September.</p>
